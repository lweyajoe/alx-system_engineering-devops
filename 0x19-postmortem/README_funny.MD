# Pathologist's Report

**Issue Summary:**
Well, folks, gather 'round! On 01/08/2023,, our job board project decided to take a little break, like a mischievous cat knocking over your coffee mug. This unexpected hiatus lasted approximately 3 generations, and during this impromptu siesta, our platform decided to moonlight as a sloth. Users experienced the frustration of slower-than-molasses loading times, and some even wondered if they'd accidentally wandered into the dial-up era. Approximately all of our users joined the slow-motion party. So, what was the root cause of this unplanned sluggishness, you ask? Brace yourselvesâ€”it was none other than a web server that had apparently mistaken itself for a contestant in a "Snail Race to the Server Farm" competition!

**Timeline:**
- On full moon: Our story begins when users started ringing the alarm bells, complaining about the job board platform's snail-like pace.
- Actions Taken: Our vigilant monitoring system raised an eyebrow at the increased response times and nudged the engineering team, who embarked on a quest to unearth the cause. Initially, they suspected the database of harboring secrets.
- Misleading Investigation: Like detectives chasing the wrong suspect, we initially honed in on the database, thinking it might be playing hard to get. However, it turned out the database was innocent, and our web server was the true culprit.
- Escalation: The incident received a VIP pass to the senior engineering team, who swooped in to save the day.
- Resolution: After some Sherlock Holmes-level sleuthing, we discovered the server's identity crisis. A misconfiguration had turned our server into a slow-dancing sloth. We adjusted its settings to get it back in the fast lane.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The root cause of the issue was an identity crisis within our web server. It mistakenly thought it was auditioning for the role of a tortoise in a reboot of Aesop's "The Tortoise and the Hare." This misconfiguration slowed response times to a crawl.

To resolve the issue, we performed the following steps:
- Played therapist to our server, helping it rediscover its true identity as a speedy web server.
- Tweaked its settings to ensure it handled traffic like an Olympic sprinter.
- Watched closely as response times returned to normal, and users no longer felt like they were trapped in slow motion.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
To prevent our server from having an identity crisis again and ensure a smoother user experience, we've cooked up these corrective and preventative measures:

1. Server Self-Confidence Workshops: Our server will attend regular self-confidence workshops to keep its identity intact.

2. Speedy Gonzales Monitoring: We're upgrading our monitoring system to spot server identity crises from a mile away.

3. Identity Documentation: We'll maintain an identity document for our server, so it never forgets who it is.

4. Speed Trials: Conducting speed trials for our server to ensure it's in top form.

5. Incident Response Rehearsals: Practicing incident response procedures to avoid any confusion during future slowdowns.

With these measures in place, we're confident that our server will stay true to itself and keep delivering lightning-fast performance.
